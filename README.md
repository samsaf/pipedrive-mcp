Additional features:

- Async API client with comprehensive error handling
- Feature flags to enable/disable specific modules
- Vertical slice architecture for maintainability
- Comprehensive test coverage
- **Remote deployment** support (Vercel, Docker, VPS)
- **Bearer token authentication** for secure remote access
- **CORS support** for Claude.ai Custom Connectors
- **Streamable HTTP transport** for serverless environments

## Quick Start with Claude Code

The fastest way to get started with the Pipedrive MCP Server and set it up in your claude desktop app:

### 1. Install Required Tools

Open your terminal or command prompt and run these commands:

```bash
# Install Python's uv package manager (if not already installed)
curl -sSf https://install.python-uv.org/uv | python3 -
```

For more detailed installation instructions for uv, visit: [Astral's UV Installation Documentation](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/README.md#installation)

### 2. Download the Code

**No GitHub account required!** Just run these commands in your terminal:

Select a folder where you want the code to be downloaded to and run these commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository (download the code)
git clone https://github.com/Wirasm/pipedrive-mcp.git

# Move into the project folder
cd pipedrive-mcp
```

### 3. Install Python Dependencies

Open your terminal and run this command exactly as written:

```bash
# Install all required packages
uv sync
```

### 4. Set Up Your Pipedrive Credentials

1. Find the `.env.example` file in the project folder
2. Make a copy and rename it to just `.env`
3. Open the `.env` file in any text editor
4. Replace the placeholders with your actual Pipedrive information:

```
PIPEDRIVE_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
PIPEDRIVE_COMPANY_DOMAIN=your_company_domain
```

All other configurations you see in the .env file are optional and can be left as is.

**To get your Pipedrive API Token:**
1. Log in to your Pipedrive account
2. Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner
3. Select "Personal preferences"
4. Go to the "API" tab
5. Click "Generate new token" if you don't already have one
6. Copy the generated token and paste it in the `.env` file

**For the company domain:**
If your Pipedrive URL is `https://mycompany.pipedrive.com/pipeline`, then your domain is `mycompany`

### 5. Install the MCP Server in Claude Desktop

Open your terminal and run this command:

```bash
# Install the MCP server
mcp install server.py
```

This will automatically register the Pipedrive tools with Claude Desktop. 

### 6. Start Using Pipedrive with Claude

1. **Important:** Restart Claude Desktop app if it was already running
2. Open Claude Desktop
3. Start a new chat, and Claude can now interact with your Pipedrive CRM!

Try asking Claude to "Show me my recent deals" or "Create a new contact here are the details: ..." to get started.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Fast Python package manager
- [mcp CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/mcp-concept) - Claude's Model Control Protocol tools
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional) - For containerized deployment

### Security Notes

This MCP server implements several security measures:

- Default binding to localhost (127.0.0.1) when running locally
- Bearer token authentication for remote deployments (`MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`)
- CORS headers for controlled cross-origin access
- Proper error handling and logging

When deploying:
- For local development, keep the default host (127.0.0.1)
- For container deployment, set `CONTAINER_MODE=true`
- For remote deployment, always set `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` to secure the server

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Wirasm/pipedrive-mcp.git
cd pipedrive-mcp
```

### Setup Environment

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
# OR
.venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
uv pip install -e .
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory (copy from `.env.example`):

```
# API Credentials
PIPEDRIVE_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
PIPEDRIVE_COMPANY_DOMAIN=your_company_domain  # Just the subdomain (e.g., "mycompany")

# Server Configuration
HOST=127.0.0.1  # Use 127.0.0.1 for local development, 0.0.0.0 only in containers
PORT=8152
TRANSPORT=sse   # "sse", "stdio", or "streamable-http"

# Security Settings
MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=          # Leave empty for local dev, set for remote deployments
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*        # CORS origins (comma-separated, or * for all)
CONTAINER_MODE=false
VERIFY_SSL=true

# Feature Flags (optional)
PIPEDRIVE_FEATURE_PERSONS=true
PIPEDRIVE_FEATURE_DEALS=true
PIPEDRIVE_FEATURE_ORGANIZATIONS=true
PIPEDRIVE_FEATURE_LEADS=true
PIPEDRIVE_FEATURE_ITEM_SEARCH=true
PIPEDRIVE_FEATURE_ACTIVITIES=true
```

### Run Tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```

### Install to Claude Desktop

```bash
mcp install server.py
```

### Run Locally

```bash
uv run server.py
```

### Using Docker (Local)

```bash
docker build -t pipedrive-mcp .

docker run -d -p 8152:8152 \
  -e PIPEDRIVE_API_TOKEN="your-api-token" \
  -e PIPEDRIVE_COMPANY_DOMAIN="mycompany" \
  -e TRANSPORT=sse \
  --name pipedrive-mcp-server \
  pipedrive-mcp
```

Or with docker-compose:

```bash
# Set your env vars in .env then:
docker compose up -d
```

## Remote Deployment

### Option A — Vercel (recommended for serverless)

1. Fork this repo
2. Connect it to Vercel
3. Configure the environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:
   - `PIPEDRIVE_API_TOKEN` — your Pipedrive API token
   - `PIPEDRIVE_COMPANY_DOMAIN` — your company subdomain (e.g., `mycompany`)
   - `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` — generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`
4. Deploy
5. Your MCP server URL: `https://your-project.vercel.app/mcp`

The Vercel deployment uses the **Streamable HTTP** transport, which is ideal for serverless environments.

### Option B — Docker (VPS / Cloud)

```bash
docker run -d -p 8152:8152 \
  -e PIPEDRIVE_API_TOKEN="your-api-token" \
  -e PIPEDRIVE_COMPANY_DOMAIN="mycompany" \
  -e MCP_AUTH_TOKEN="your-secret-token" \
  -e TRANSPORT=sse \
  pipedrive-mcp
```

### Health Check

All deployments expose a `GET /health` endpoint (no auth required):

```bash
curl https://your-server/health
# {"status": "ok", "version": "1.0.0", "features": ["persons", "deals", ...]}
```

## Client Configuration

### Claude Desktop (claude_desktop_config.json)

For remote servers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pipedrive": {
      "url": "https://your-project.vercel.app/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer your-secret-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add pipedrive \
  --transport http \
  https://your-project.vercel.app/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token"
```

### Claude.ai (Custom Connector)

```
URL: https://your-project.vercel.app/mcp
```

> Note: Custom Connectors on claude.ai may not support custom auth headers yet. For claude.ai, consider an OAuth-based approach or a token-in-URL mechanism.
